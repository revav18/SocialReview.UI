A component should present properties and methods for data binding to mediate between the view and the application logic. A component should use services for tasks that don't involve the view or application logic. Services are good for tasks such as fetching data from the server, validating user input, or logging directly to the console.

To generate a new component, run:
    ng generate component 'component-name' without the quotations. You could also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.
